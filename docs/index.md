# Introduction

Hedgehog Open Network Fabric is an open networking platform that brings the user experience enjoyed by so many in the
public cloud to the private environments. Without vendor lock-in.

Fabric is built around concept of VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) similar to the public clouds and provides a multi-tenant
API to define user intent on network isolation, connectivity and etc which gets automatically transformed into switches
and software appliances configuration.

You can read more about [concepts](concepts/overview.md) and [architecture](architecture/overview.md) in the
documentation.

You can find how to [download](getting-started/download.md) and try Fabric on the self-hosted
[fully virtualized lab](vlab/overview.md) or on the [hardware](install-upgrade/overview.md).
